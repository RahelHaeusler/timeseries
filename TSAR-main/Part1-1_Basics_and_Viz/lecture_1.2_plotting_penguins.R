# Copy from Github Rep
# ==================================== 

# ====== Install and load necessary packages

# We can install an load ggplot2 as a package:
install.packages("ggplot2")  
library(ggplot2) 

# Or we can install and load it as part of the tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

# Install and load the package plotly for interactive plots:
install.packages("plotly") 
library(plotly)

# Install a package that contains penguin data from the Palmer Archipelago in the Antarctica:
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)

# =====  Get a first idea of the penguins data set

View(penguins)
help("penguins")
glimpse(penguins) # glimpse() shows you all the attributes, their data types and some example values. glimpse() is part of the dyplyr package, which in turn is part of the tidyverse collection of packages.
summary(penguins) # summary() is a generic function. Applied to a data set, it gives you summary statistics of all attributes.
