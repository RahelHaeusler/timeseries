# Remark: you can load the object alternatively by clicking in the filename in the "Files" tab of the "Output Pane" of RStudio.
# When you do this, RStudio asks you under which name you want to load the object in your environment.

# Save my_list and my_df as an Rdata file. Then remove both variables from your environment and load the saved RData file again.
save(my_list, my_df, file = "my_stuff.Rdata") # check 
rm(my_list) # rm() removes objects from the environment. Check ?rm.

# Notice: Since more than one object is stored in my_stuff.Rdata, I did not assign the output to a variable (like I did with readRDS above).
# Instead, the objects are automatically loaded under the original variable names. (Check the environment pane: my_list and my_df are there again.)
# This can accidentally overwrite an object name that is already in your envirinment - especially, when you don't know or don't remember what is inside the Rdata file.
# Thus, it is always safer to use saveRDS(), saving all objects separately.
# You can check what happens if you assign the output of load() to a varible:
my_stuff <- load("my_stuff.Rdata") 
my_stuff
typeof(my_stuff) # the names of the included objects are stored in a character vector, but the objects themselves are not loaded.
